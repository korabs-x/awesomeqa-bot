***Customer support in web3 is messy, chaotic, and - most of all - a painful user experience.***

AwesomeQA is a community support tool designed to help Community Managers provide the best possible customer support for their users.

The AwesomeQA discord bot automatically answers repetitive questions asked in the server and requires not manual setup by the support staff.

For trying out the bot, simply [invite the bot](https://awesomeqa.xyz/) to your server and [ping us](mailto:hi@awesomeqa.xyz) to activate the bot.

If you have any feedback or feature requests, feel free to contact us at [hi@awesomeqa.xyz](mailto:hi@awesomeqa.xyz).

We're looking forward to transforming community support and democratizing information about web3 products!
